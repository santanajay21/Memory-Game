# Memory-Game
A simple game made in vanilla Javascript ,HTML, and css


This memory Game is a game of concentration. Where you try to remeber where you last saw the images.
Memory Game was more for me. A helpful way for me to learn a cement my understanding of Javascript methods,loops, functions, and attributes. While peacing this game together I wrote down notes in each section that helped me understand what was going on in different sections of the code. I did not use too much Css, or HTML because my focus was on working and dunerstanding the functionality of the game. This game was a great learning experience for me ,and I hope you all enjoy.
